I was able to ensure my images had an alt text atrribute. Unfortunatley I don't think I was able to implement anything else.

From Friday I had a little bit of trouble understanding Javascript and putting this into play with the help given.
I reached out a few times to my other collegues which I received success from.
Ashir told me a couple things that he found, like used a 'for' not a 'forEach' function worked for him, and that he had started with just applying an image to the DOM and working outwards like that.
Using the codes we used in the workshop I was able to get to the point of displaying my first image, I had set up my loop but it was unable to shop me the other images. Another debugging with Ashir changing my index value from 0 to i had all three images, then after flexboxing and styling I had them at the top of my page.

After a couple days now I've been unable to make the event of them appearing bigger happen.

Funnily enough, I had it to the point of everytime I clicked my images, in the console their appeared to be a fault, and next to the fault it had a counter which would count how many times I had clicked it, but I was unable to figure out the next part out.

I had a lot of comments in my code that were mainly workings out that had failed, before submitting I thought I would take them out, and now it appears to have changed my output by quite a bit.
Now everytime I click on an image it adds a new one, its bigger which is a success but it doesnt take the place of the background.

As I didn't have much success I didn't feel the need to carry on with the other checkpoints.

One thing that become apparent is that some of the functions I couldn't understand, I could when I looked back into the workshops, but hard to apply it to what we were trying to acheive. I can understand the functions with the examples given but would benefit from a simpler explaination of what the functions are doing, if such a thing exists?

Its been a rollercoaster of a weekend that I'll be riding for the next 10 weeks, just hoping the Javascript side of things become easier. Still I got a lot further then where I was last Friday evening.
